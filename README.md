# 🖋️ Auto Typer – Because I'm Too Lazy to Type 😎

Auto Typer is a simple GUI-based tool created out of pure laziness.  
I built it while using ChatGPT to generate a huge list of over 1000 project topics — and I just couldn’t keep typing and pressing **Enter** again and again.

So instead of wasting time, I made a tool that does it for me 💡

## ✨ Features

- ⌨️ Automatically types and sends your custom message at a set time interval
- ⏱️ Fully customizable time delay (in seconds)
- 🔁 Repeats until you manually stop it
- 🎯 Works in *any* application with a blinking input cursor (like ChatGPT, browsers, messengers, etc.)
- 🪟 Tiny and easy-to-use GUI

---

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Open the app**
2. **Click your cursor** on the input field of the app where you want to type (e.g. ChatGPT chat box, browser text box, etc.)
3. Enter:
   - **Interval** (in seconds) – how long to wait between sends
   - **Text** – what to send
4. Click the **Start** button
5. The Auto Typer will switch to the last used app and start sending your message on loop
6. Click **Stop** when you want it to stop

## ⚠️ Notes

- While it's running, **do not click away** from the input field you're targeting — or the message will go to the wrong place.
- It **doesn’t stop automatically** if focus is lost — so be careful and click **Stop** manually when done.
- Best experience: Start it and *let it run without touching your mouse or keyboard*.

## 🧪 Why I Made This

I was using ChatGPT to generate massive lists of project ideas. But typing “next,” “more,” or hitting enter over and over was annoying. So I built this to do that for me — and now I use it whenever I need to repeat typing tasks.

## 🛠 Built With

- Python 🐍
- tkinter – for the GUI
- pyautogui – for typing automation
- threading – to keep the app responsive

Enjoy being lazy — the smart way 😁
